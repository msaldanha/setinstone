# SetInStone project

## What is it?

First, it is my pet project and isn't finished.

A distributed DB to store data.

It is called SetInStone because changes in the data are not allowed and, once stored, can't be changed.

The data form a chain (like a blockchain) and are cryptographically protected and tied to the previous data, making impossible to third parties tamper with them. 

The data (records) are stored in the IPFS network making them available everywhere in the world.

## How to use?

Import it on your project

One example of application that uses it is Pulpit (github.com/msaldanha/pulpit)
